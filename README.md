# ðŸ‘“ Live Demo
https://paint-online-kirillgoryakin.vercel.app/

Used [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) for hosting frontend and [Render.com](https://render.com/) for backend.

If your backend hosting closes websocket connection ([Render.com](https://render.com/) closes it after 5 min), you have to regularly reconnect to the server. This project has such feature implemented. You can activate and set reconnection timeout by providing these ENV variables to your **frontend**:
```
REACT_APP_DO_RECONNECT=true
REACT_APP_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT=240000
```
*240 000 ms = 4 min. You can set your own timeout.*
# Development
### Instalation:
Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/KirillGoryakin/Paint-Online.git

If the server cannot be reached from client you'll see and error message, but you still will be able to continue offline.

Client doesn't have links to the server. Provide them with ENV variables. If you are in developing mod, you can just create a `.env.local` file in `/client/` folder and write this:
```
REACT_APP_HTTP_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:5000
```
### Start client and server:
```
npm run start
```
### Start only client:
```
npm run client
```
### Start only server:
```
npm run server
```
